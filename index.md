Hi, I'm Albert and welcome to my website! It's currently a work in progress, but when it's done it will host a bio about me, my projects, and some miscellaneous articles/tutorials/blogs that I write about whatever I'm interested in.

# To-do:
- Embed links to my [Github](https://github.com/abhchow) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhchow/) in either the header, footer or a sidebar.
- Link to my resume
- Showcase [previous projects](https://www.youtube.com/@DrumsofWar)
- Set up Jeykll
- Set my own Jekyll to render md to html
- Set up MathJax to render LaTeX via Jekyll

# Examples for me to reference

Here is a sentence with some `in line code` embedded in it.

Markdown supports syntax highlighting for code blocks. Here's a block of Python code:
```python
# here is some other code
for i in range(5):
    print("hello")
```

And a block of Matlab code:
```matlab
x = 5:9;

for i=x:
    display(i)
end
```


$$3^{4}=3\times3\times3\times3$$
