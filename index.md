Hi, I'm Albert and welcome to my website! It's currently a work in progress, but when it's done it will host a bio about me, my projects, and some miscellaneous articles/tutorials/blogs that I write about whatever I'm interested in.

Here is a sentence with some `in line code` embedded in it.

Markdown supports syntax highlighting for code blocks. Here's a block of Python code:
```python
# here is some other code
for i in range(5):
    print("hello")
```

And a block of Matlab code:
```matlab
x = 5:9;

for i=x:
    display(i)
end
```
