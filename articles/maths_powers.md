# Aren't powers just repeated multiplication?

In mathematics, a core approach to developing our ideas is that of _extending_ definitions. Let's explore this by taking a look at the concept of _powers_, which you should be familiar with from high school. Back then, you probably learnt that the definition of a power is just repeated multiplication:

$$ 3^{4} = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 $$

Often when we start with a definition like this, we notice that it produces other properties that are always true. To demonstrate this, let's take a look at what happens when you take two different powers of a number and multiply  $3^{4}=3\times3\times3\times3$ them together:
