# Why bother writing units?

_Don't forget your units._ You hear your maths and physics teachers drilling this into you every time you write a number without a unit on the end. Why?

In this article, we're going to explore why we use units, what makes them useful, and help you understand them in a way that'll make you _want_ to use them when you do maths, instead of _have_ to use them.

## What are units?
A _unit_ tells you what a number represents. 20m, 20s, 20Â°C, 20kg. Each of these has the same number, but they mean very different things - there's no direct way to convert between distances, time, temperature and mass. The unit attached to the number is what gives us the distinction between these different physical quantities.

In the SI system of units, we have 7 base units. We won't be exploring these in this article, but you can read about them (here)[] if you don't already know about them.

## Why do we care about them?


## How do you work with units?
The best way to understand how to work with units is by thinking about how you work with numbers in general. They work in a very similar way, so looking at how we work with numbers will teach you how you can work with units.

### Adding and subtracting units
If you have 5 apples and add another 7 apples, how many apples do you end up with? Obviously, 
$$ 5 apples + 7 apples = 12 apples $$
