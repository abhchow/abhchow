# Hey there! I'm Albert ðŸ‘‹

This repository holds a basic website that I've made to showcase my personal projects.

It's a work in progress, but when it's done it'll hold my portfolio of projects, some articles and maybe a few other random things. Don't expect the website to be too pretty, I'm just messing around here. This website is built using Jekyll to render Markdown to HTML, and MathJax to render LaTeX.

## About Me 

I graduated from Monash University in Melbourne with a Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Science (with majors in Mathematics and Computational Science). I also spent several years tutoring numerous subjects in the Engineering and IT Faculties, and have a passion for teaching STEM.

As I keep working on this website, you'll see lots more of me writing about STEM topics, particularly in things that I think are poorly understood and that I have a unique perspective on. Right now I'm working in industry and don't have much of an opportunity to teach, so writing articles about these things is a creative outlet for me to be able to keep teaching.
